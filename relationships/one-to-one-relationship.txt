ðŸ“˜ One-to-One (1:1) Relationship

ðŸ”¹ Definition
    A One-to-One relationship means:
    Each row in Table A is linked to at most one row in Table B.
    And vice versa.

ðŸ”¹ When to Use
    To split data into multiple tables when:
        Some attributes are optional.
        Some data is sensitive/secure and stored separately.
        To reduce table size for performance.

ðŸ”¹ Example

ðŸ‘¤ Each Citizen has one Passport, and each Passport belongs to only one Citizen.

CREATE TABLE Citizen (
    citizen_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Passport (
    passport_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    citizen_id INT UNIQUE,
    FOREIGN KEY (citizen_id) REFERENCES Citizen(citizen_id)
);

citizen_id in Passport is marked UNIQUE, ensuring one passport â†” one citizen.

ðŸ”¹ Key Point
    Always enforce UNIQUE constraint on the foreign key to maintain true 1:1 mapping.
