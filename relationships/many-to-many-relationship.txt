ðŸ“˜ Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship

ðŸ”¹ Definition
    A Many-to-Many relationship means:
        A row in Table A can be linked to many rows in Table B.
        And a row in Table B can also be linked to many rows in Table A.
    Implemented using a junction (bridge) table.

ðŸ”¹ When to Use
    When two entities naturally have multiple associations.
    Example:
        Students take multiple Courses.
        Each Course has multiple Students.

ðŸ”¹ Example
ðŸŽ“ Students â†” Courses

CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Course (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Junction Table
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES Student(student_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES Course(course_id)
);

Enrollment is the junction table.
A student can enroll in many courses.
A course can have many students.

ðŸ”¹ Key Point
    Always requires a third table (junction table).
    Primary Key in junction table is usually a composite key (student_id + course_id).
