📘 One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship


🔹 Definition
    A One-to-Many relationship means:
    A single row in Table A can be linked to many rows in Table B.
    But each row in Table B is linked to only one row in Table A.


🔹 When to Use
    Most common relationship in databases.
    Used when one entity has multiple dependent entities.

🔹 Example
🏢 One Department can have many Employees, but each Employee belongs to only one Department.

CREATE TABLE Department (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id)
);

dept_id in Employee is a Foreign Key → links employee to a department.
One department may have many employees, but an employee belongs to only one department.

🔹 Key Point
    Implemented using a Foreign Key in the “many” side (Employee table here).
