📘 First Normal Form (1NF)

🔹 Definition

    1NF = A table is in First Normal Form if:
        All columns contain atomic values (indivisible).
        No repeating groups or arrays.
        Each row is unique (usually enforced by a primary key).

🔹 Why 1NF?

    To eliminate duplicate or multi-valued fields.
    Makes querying and indexing easier.

🔹 Example

❌ Not in 1NF (Subjects column has multiple values)

Student Table
+----+-------+------------------+
| ID | Name  | Subjects         |
+----+-------+------------------+
| 1  | Raj   | Math, Science    |
| 2  | Priya | English, History |

✅ In 1NF (Each value atomic, one subject per row)

Student Table
+----+-------+---------+
| ID | Name  | Subject |
+----+-------+---------+
| 1  | Raj   | Math    |
| 1  | Raj   | Science |
| 2  | Priya | English |
| 2  | Priya | History |

🔹 Key Points

    Atomic values → Each cell contains only one value.
    Unique rows → Each record must be uniquely identifiable.
    No repeating groups → Do not store multiple items in a single column.

⚡ Shortcut:
    1NF = Atomic + Unique rows + No repeating groups
