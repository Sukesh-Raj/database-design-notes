📘 Lookup Table

🔹 Definition

    A Lookup Table is a small reference table used to store a fixed set of values.
    Purpose: Avoid repeating the same values in multiple rows and ensure consistency.

🔹 Why Use Lookup Tables?

    Data Consistency – prevents typos (e.g., "HR", "hr", "Hr").
    Easy Maintenance – change once in lookup table → reflects everywhere.
    Smaller Storage – instead of storing text repeatedly, store an ID.
    Better Performance – joins with integer IDs are faster.

🔹 Example

    Suppose you want to store Employee Department.
    Instead of writing "HR", "Finance", "IT" repeatedly in Employee table → use a Lookup Table.

    -- Lookup Table
    CREATE TABLE Department (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(50)
    );

    -- Employee Table
    CREATE TABLE Employee (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    dept_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id)
    );

Department = Lookup table.
Employee.dept_id points to Department.dept_id.
If you change "IT" to "Information Technology" in Department, it’s updated for all employees.

🔹Real-World Examples of Lookup Tables

    Country Codes 🌍 (IN = India, US = United States, etc.)
    Order Status 🛒 (Pending, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled)
    User Roles 👤 (Admin, Editor, Viewer)

🔹Key Point

    Lookup tables usually contain two columns:
        An ID (Primary Key)
        A Descriptive Value (name, type, status, etc.)
