üîë Types of Keys

1.Primary Key

    Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
    Cannot be NULL.
    Only one primary key per table.

2.Candidate Key

    A set of attributes that can qualify as a primary key.
    Every table can have multiple candidate keys, but only one is chosen as the primary key.

    ‚úÖ Example: In Student(roll_no, email, phone):
        roll_no, email, phone ‚Üí all are candidate keys.

    We might pick roll_no as the primary key.

3.Super Key

    A set of attributes that uniquely identify rows, but may contain extra unnecessary attributes.
    All candidate keys are super keys, but not all super keys are candidate keys.

    ‚úÖ Example: In Employee(emp_id, email, phone):
        {emp_id} ‚Üí Candidate key (also super key).
        {emp_id, email} ‚Üí Super key (but not candidate).

4.Foreign Key

    An attribute in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.
    Used to establish relationships.

    ‚úÖ Example:
        CREATE TABLE Department (
        dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        dept_name VARCHAR(50)
        );

        CREATE TABLE Employee (
        emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(50),
        dept_id INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Department(dept_id)
        );

5.Composite Key

    A key made up of two or more attributes that together uniquely identify a row.

    ‚úÖ Example:
        CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
        student_id INT,
        course_id INT,
        PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
        );
    
    Here, neither student_id nor course_id alone is unique, but together they form a composite key.

6.Alternate Key

    A candidate key that is not chosen as the primary key.

    ‚úÖ Example: In Student(roll_no, email, phone)
    roll_no = Primary key.
    email and phone = Alternate keys.

7.Unique Key

    Similar to primary key but:
        Allows NULL values (one per column).
        Can have multiple unique keys in a table.

| Key Type      | Uniqueness   | NULL Allowed | Count per Table | Example                   |
| ------------- | ----------   | ------------ | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| Primary Key   | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚ùå No         | Only 1          | `emp_id`                  |
| Candidate Key | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚ùå No         | Many possible   | `email`, `phone`          |
| Super Key     | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ Yes        | Many            | `{emp_id, email}`         |
| Foreign Key   | ‚ùå No       | ‚úÖ Yes        | Many            | `dept_id`                 |
| Composite Key | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚ùå No         | Many            | `(student_id, course_id)` |
| Alternate Key | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚ùå No         | Many            | `phone`                   |
| Unique Key    | ‚úÖ Yes      | ‚úÖ One NULL   | Many            | `email`                   |
