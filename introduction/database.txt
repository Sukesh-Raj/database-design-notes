ðŸ“˜ Database

Definition:
A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

Key Points:
    Stores related data in a structured way.
    Ensures consistency, security, and integrity of data.
    Allows multiple users to access and manipulate data simultaneously.

Example:
    A university database may store:
        Students (roll_no, name, dept)
        Courses (course_id, title, credits)
        Enrollments (student_id, course_id, grade)


Types of Databases:

    Relational Database (RDBMS) â€“ Uses tables (rows & columns). Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

    NoSQL Database â€“ Non-relational, flexible schema. Example: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

    Distributed Database â€“ Spread across multiple machines. Example: Google Spanner.


Why Use a Database (instead of files)?

    Avoids data redundancy.
    Provides fast querying with indexes.
    Ensures data security & backup.
    Supports transactions (ACID properties).
