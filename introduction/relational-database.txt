ðŸ”¹ Relational Database

A relational database stores data in the form of relations (tables).
Each table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields).
Relationships are used to connect data across multiple tables.

Example:
    Student Table: (student_id, name, age)
    Course Table: (course_id, title)
    Enrollment Table: (student_id, course_id) â†’ links students to courses.


ðŸ”¹ Entity

An entity = a real-world object that we want to store data about.
Represented as a table in a relational database.
Each entity has instances (rows/records).

Example:
    Student is an entity.
    Rows like (101, "Alice", 20), (102, "Bob", 21) are entity instances.


ðŸ”¹ Attributes

Attributes = properties/characteristics of an entity.
Represented as columns in a table.
Each attribute has a domain (set of allowed values).

Example:

    For entity Student:
        student_id (integer)
        name (string)
        age (integer, must be > 0)
