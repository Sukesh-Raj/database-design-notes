📘 Atomic Values

🔹 Definition
    An atomic value = a value that is indivisible (cannot be broken down into smaller meaningful parts).
    In relational databases, each cell in a table must store only one atomic value → this is the rule of First Normal Form (1NF).

🔹 Example

❌ Non-atomic values (violates 1NF)

Student Table
+------------+------------------+
| student_id | phone_numbers    |
+------------+------------------+
| 1          | 9876543210,9123  |

phone_numbers stores multiple values in one column → not atomic.

✅ Atomic values (follows 1NF)

Student Table
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | phone_number |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 9876543210   |
| 1          | 9123         |

Each cell has a single value.

🔹 Why Atomic Values Matter
    Avoids confusion when querying.
    Ensures data consistency.
    Allows applying constraints, indexing, and searching efficiently.
